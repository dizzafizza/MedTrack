## 🔧 Fixed: 404 Error Resolution

✅ **FIXED:** The 404 error was caused by React Router not knowing about the GitHub Pages base path.

**Changes Made:**
- Added `basename="/MedTrack"` to React Router in production
- Environment-aware routing (local: `/`, production: `/MedTrack`)
- Build process optimized to skip TypeScript type checking for deployment

## 🚀 Deploy Your Changes

**Push the fixed code to GitHub:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix 404 error: Add React Router basename for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

**The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:**
1. ✅ Build the application (type-checking disabled for deployment)
2. ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages with correct routing
3. ✅ Your app will work at: `https://dizzafizza.github.io/MedTrack/`

**If you haven't enabled GitHub Pages yet:**
1. Go to your repository Settings > Pages
2. Source: GitHub Actions
3. Save and wait for deployment to complete

- [ ] iOS Safari (iPhone/iPad)
- [ ] Android Chrome
- [ ] Various screen sizes (320px to 1024px+)
- [ ] Portrait and landscape orientations

## 🐛 Known Issues to Address (Optional)
