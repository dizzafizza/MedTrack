## 🔧 Fixed: GitHub Pages 404 Blank Page Error

✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED:** Multiple issues resolved for blank page problem:

### **Primary Issue: Wrong Homepage URL**
- ❌ **Was:** `"homepage": "https://github.com/your-username/MedTrack#readme"`
- ✅ **Fixed:** `"homepage": "https://dizzafizza.github.io/MedTrack"`

### **Routing Solution: Switched to HashRouter**
- ❌ **Problem:** BrowserRouter needs server-side routing (not available on GitHub Pages)
- ✅ **Solution:** HashRouter works perfectly with static hosting
- ✅ **URLs now:** `https://dizzafizza.github.io/MedTrack/#/dashboard`

### **Additional Fixes:**
- ✅ Added 404.html for SPA support
- ✅ Added redirect script to index.html
- ✅ Build process optimized to skip TypeScript checking

## 🚀 Deploy Your Changes

**Push the fixed code to GitHub:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: GitHub Pages blank page - HashRouter + correct homepage"
git push origin main
```

**The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:**
1. ✅ Build the application (type-checking disabled for deployment)
2. ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages with correct routing
3. ✅ Your app will work at: `https://dizzafizza.github.io/MedTrack/`

**If you haven't enabled GitHub Pages yet:**
1. Go to your repository Settings > Pages
2. Source: GitHub Actions
3. Save and wait for deployment to complete
